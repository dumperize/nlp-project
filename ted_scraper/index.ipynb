He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education.

A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of \\u003cem\\u003eBusiness 2.0\\u003c/em\\u003e magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eThis success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eHe expanded the conference\\u0026#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients \\u0026quot;one wish to change the world.\\u0026quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eIn 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to \\u0026#39;ideas worth spreading,\\u0026#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education. After boarding school in Bath, England, he went on to Oxford University, graduating in 1978 with a degree in philosophy, politics and economics.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eChris then trained as a journalist, working in newspapers and radio, including two years producing a world news service in the Seychelles Islands.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003e Back in the UK in 1984, Chris was captivated by the personal computer revolution and became an editor at one of the UK\\u0026#39;s early computer magazines. A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of \\u003cem\\u003eBusiness 2.0\\u003c/em\\u003e magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eThis success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eHe expanded the conference\\u0026#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients \\u0026quot;one wish to change the world.\\u0026quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eIn 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to \\u0026#39;ideas worth spreading,\\u0026#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world.

More than 8,000 such events have been held, generating an archive of 60,000 TEDx talks.

He spent his early years in India, Pakistan and Afghanistan, where his parents worked as medical missionaries, and he attended an American school in the Himalayas for his early education.

A year later he founded Future Publishing with a $25,000 bank loan. The new company initially focused on specialist computer publications but eventually expanded into other areas such as cycling, music, video games, technology and design, doubling in size every year for seven years. In 1994, Chris moved to the United States where he built Imagine Media, publisher of \\u003cem\\u003eBusiness 2.0\\u003c/em\\u003e magazine and creator of the popular video game users website IGN. Chris eventually merged Imagine and Future, taking the combined entity public in London in 1999, under the Future name. At its peak, it published 150 magazines and websites and employed 2,000 people.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eThis success allowed Chris to create a private nonprofit organization, the Sapling Foundation, with the hope of finding new ways to tackle tough global issues through media, technology, entrepreneurship and, most of all, ideas. In 2001, the foundation acquired the TED Conference, then an annual meeting of luminaries in the fields of Technology, Entertainment and Design held in Monterey, California, and Chris left Future to work full time on TED.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eHe expanded the conference\\u0026#39;s remit to cover all topics, including science, business and key global issues, while adding a Fellows program, which now has some 300 alumni, and the TED Prize, which grants its recipients \\u0026quot;one wish to change the world.\\u0026quot; The TED stage has become a place for thinkers and doers from all fields to share their ideas and their work, capturing imaginations, sparking conversation and encouraging discovery along the way.\\u003c/p\\u003e\\u003cp class=\\\"p1\\\"\\u003eIn 2006, TED experimented with posting some of its talks on the Internet. Their viral success encouraged Chris to begin positioning the organization as a global media initiative devoted to \\u0026#39;ideas worth spreading,\\u0026#39; part of a new era of information dissemination using the power of online video. In June 2015, the organization posted its 2,000th talk online. The talks are free to view, and they have been translated into more than 100 languages with the help of volunteers from around the world.

But climate tech investor Gabriel Kra thinks we need to reframe the crisis as a source of tremendous opportunity. He offers five big reasons to be optimistic about climate -- starting with the fact that many of the world's best minds are focused and working on building a clean future for all.\", 'transcript': \"We need to change the way we think about the climate challenge. Because things are different this time. We need to stop thinking about it just as a problem, which it obviously is, and start thinking about it as an opportunity which will motivate us to solve it. I'm a venture investor. I invest in early stage companies and technologies, and I see tremendous opportunities in solving climate change. That said, we've been here before, and it's different this time. We can reduce net emissions to zero. And that was not obvious even just 10 years ago. Why do I think it's different? Because we have cheaper inputs, we have better technologies. We have better policies. We have a better sense of urgency. And most important of all, we have even better people working on it. I'm from Silicon Valley, and you can laugh or shrug if you think that the Valley is more part of the problem than part of the solution. But consider this. To succeed, if we want to succeed, we have to act at such a truly massive scale. We need the best investors and entrepreneurs on our team. And it's a fact that some 15 years ago, a bunch of us started working on technologies and companies that could help solve climate change. And we had some successes, in solar and in wind, in electric vehicles and transportation. But, accelerated by the Great Recession of 2008, climate tech, clean tech came to be seen as a string of investment failures. I don't think we failed. We were a little bit early and a little bit naive. We didn't have all those building blocks. Not enough of us knew that solving climate change was the greatest business opportunity of our generation. And we were a little bit naive. We underestimated how hard it was going to be to disrupt entrenched companies and industries that did not want to change. But now so many more people are invested in solving it. We have those building blocks, and we have even more people working on it. That's why I'm so optimistic and excited, why it's different this time. Let me detail a few. First, we have cheaper inputs. The biggest input in our economy and the dominant cost is energy. Until now, the dominant source of energy is fossils: coal, oil, gas. Climate change is caused by burning fossil fuels. But now, prompted by incredible decline in cost, solar and wind are the cheapest forms of electricity, most places on the planet. Until recently, while we knew that fossils were the source of the problem, we had no alternatives. Stopping fossils would have meant stopping the economy. Alternatives now exist. Two, we have better technologies. Consider lithium-ion batteries and how they enabled the electric vehicle revolution. Those batteries are now being applied towards other applications and other opportunities. We have better computers and new ways of using them. Machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to big data sets enables us to explore and develop new materials. It enables us to reduce energy needs, and it enables us to solve problems in previously unimaginable ways, some as simple as software that companies use to optimize delivery routes. We use less fuel to get stuff places. The bioeconomy has CRISPR and other gene editing tools. Those can be used to help plants like wheat, corn, rice, soy grow with less inputs, less water, less fertilizer. Massive opportunities. And we are in the early stages of developing equipment that can suck carbon dioxide out of the air, with the promise of one day reversing some of the pollution we've been pouring into our atmosphere for the past 200 years. Three. We have and are developing better materials. The streets we walk on, the buildings we work in, they're made of concrete and steel. Combined, those two contribute over 15 percent of global emissions. Now we can start making buildings up to 20 stories or more high without any steel or concrete. There’s structures made of laminated mass timber, which actually sequesters carbon. And at the same time, we're developing ways of making steel and concrete without emissions. Fourth. Climate tech is now sexy, elegant and chic. Electric vehicles were invented in the 1880s. As recently as the 1990s, though, they were clunky and ugly. You couldn't go much more than 50 miles on a single charge. Now we have safe, affordable, fun-to-drive, sexy electric vehicles. I think in five years we're going to be surprised, we'll be shocked if people want to buy a gasoline version. Or consider solar panels. Not too long ago, many communities banned them from being installed on their roofs for fear that they would uglify the neighborhood. Now they look like roofs. They're a status symbol. You have to have them. Other panels are used to power not just homes but companies and factories. Messaging matters. Fifth, there is so much more money being directed towards zero-emissions investments. Solving these problems, building these companies takes hard-working entrepreneurs, and it takes money. Until not so long ago, there weren't many people willing to invest in the riskiest technologies. Now we have dedicated pools of capital focused across climate, from early-stage technologies and companies to later-stage development and massive utility scale projects that require billions of dollars, which actually encourages more capital to come in and is a [virtuous] cycle. Each of these examples -- this is not an exhaustive list -- but each of these examples are real. Real opportunities that are in development. We also have better policies. Governments are making plans that make them good partners and customers for entrepreneurs. We know so much more about climate injustice. We have real demand from the public to solve it. We have engineers and scientists and investors working around the planet on these problems. Put these things together and a clear picture emerges, a realistic pathway towards a clean future for all. These things have another characteristic. They are combinatorial. One accelerates the other. One propels the next forward. For instance, with cheap green electricity, we will soon have cheap green hydrogen. Green hydrogen can be used to power homes and factories. It can be used to make fertilizer, or it can be used to make steel without emissions. Tremendous opportunities. We're developing storage systems and batteries that are the missing link to make wind and solar firm and dispatchable, real alternatives to fossils. And ... mark my words, the combination of EVs and electric trains, remote sensors and big data analytics, it's going to revolutionize how we move people and goods around the planet. Of course, we still have a lot to do. We have to develop the solutions we have, and we have to develop and invent some to solve some wickedly hard problems, many of which I've mentioned already. For instance, how do we grow healthy food without emissions while protecting and restoring nature? How do we construct our buildings and fly airplanes without emissions? How do we recycle minerals instead of mining for new? And how do we make chemicals without drilling for oil and gas? How do we make steel without emissions and concrete that absorbs carbon dioxide at scale? And how do we all, especially big emitters like multinational corporations, track and report our emissions? Because you cannot manage what you don't measure. We need good, reliable, transparent carbon accounting. Another massive opportunity: developing carbon accounting and reporting software. Now, so many people understand the urgency of the situation. We understand that new and now go hand in hand. We can't sit around waiting for a solution. We need to get out and develop the ones we have while we invent the ones we don't have yet. And none of this happens without passionate people, and that's why I'm so excited, so optimistic. I see it everywhere, from young people in the United States who refuse to work for a company that isn’t committed to a clean future, to engineers in Africa developing the infrastructure, the water and the electricity that continent needs, but doing so sustainably. And this is also combinatorial. Great people attract more great people, which catalyzes more money, brings in even more great people. It's a virtuous cycle. Having worked -- the key factor in any effort, in any enterprise, the key factor in that success is the people. And having worked in innovation almost all my adult life, I can honestly say that the people I work with every day are, you are, the solution. We are different this time. And that’s why it’s different this time. And we will succeed.

I preached in mega churches. I was a successful, well-educated, white American male. I knew from the time I was three or four years of age I was transgender. In my naivete, I thought I got to choose. I thought a gender fairy would arrive and say, “OK, the time has come.” But alas, no gender fairy arrived. So I just lived my life. I didn\\'t hate being a boy. I just knew I wasn\\'t one. Went to college, got married, had kids, built a career. But the call toward authenticity has all the subtlety of a smoke alarm. And eventually decisions have to be made. So I came out as transgender, and I lost all of my jobs. I had never had a bad review, and I lost every single job. It\\'s not easy being a transgender woman. People sometimes ask, \"Do you feel 100 percent like a woman?\" And I say, \"Well, if you\\'ve talked to one transgender person, you\\'ve talked to exactly one transgender person. I can\\'t speak for anybody else.\" I feel 100 percent like a transgender woman. There are things a cisgender woman knows I will never know. That said, I am learning a lot about what it means to be a female. And I’m learning a lot about my former gender. I have the unique experience of having lived life from both sides, and I\\'m here to tell you, the differences are massive. So I\\'ll start with the small stuff, like the pockets on women\\'s jeans. What? Can\\'t put a phone in there. Paper clip, maybe. Or the sizing of women\\'s clothing. Do the numbers mean anything? What is a double zero? And ladies, I doubt you\\'ve thought about this, but do you know there is never a time in the life of a male that he has to worry about whether or not an article of his clothing is accidentally going to drop into the toilet? Not a long sweater, not a belt, nothing. Never even a passing thought. Now I get my hair cut about half as often as I used to, but it costs 10 times as much. So I can go on vacation or I can get my hair cut, I cannot do both. I keep bumping into gender differences everywhere I go, sometimes literally. I’m walking down the hallway, and I just bump into it. There’s nothing in the way, and I just bump into it. I think, what\\'s that about? And I know it\\'s going to leave a bruise because now that my skin is thinner, I have bruises absolutely everywhere. How I experience my sexuality is profoundly different. It\\'s less visual and more holistic. Less of a body experience and more of a being experience. I cannot count the number of times I\\'ve said to Cathy, my former wife, \"I am so, so sorry.\" I just didn\\'t know what I didn\\'t know. There is no way a well-educated white male can understand how much the culture is tilted in his favor. There\\'s no way he can understand it because it\\'s all he\\'s ever known. And all he ever will know. And conversely, there\\'s no way that a woman can understand the full import of that, because being a female is all she\\'s ever known. She might have an inkling that she\\'s working twice as hard for half as much, but she has no idea how much harder it is for her than it is for the guy in the Brooks Brothers jacket in the office across the hall. I know. I was that guy. And I thought I was one of the good guys. Sensitive to women, egalitarian. Then came the first time I ever flew as a female. Now I\\'ve flown over 2.3 million miles with American Airlines. I know my way around an airplane. And American was great through my transition, but that does not mean their passengers were. The first time I flew as Paula, I was going from Denver to Charlotte. And I got on the plane, and there was stuff in my seat. So I picked it up to put my stuff down, and a guy said, \"That\\'s my stuff.\" I said, \"OK, but it\\'s in my seat, so I’ll just hold it for you until you find your seat, and then I\\'ll give it to you.\" He said, \"Lady, that is my seat.\" I said, \"Yeah, actually, it\\'s not. It\\'s my seat.\" \"1D, 1D. But I\\'ll be glad to hold your stuff until you find your seat.\" He said, \"What do I have to tell you? That is my seat.\" I said, \"Yeah, it\\'s not.\" At which point the guy behind me said, \"Lady, would you take your effing argument elsewhere so I can get in the airplane?\" I was absolutely stunned. I had never been treated like that as a male. I would have said, \"I believe that\\'s my seat,\" and the guy immediately would have looked at his boarding pass and said, \"Oh, I\\'m sorry.\" I know that because it happened all the time. The flight attendant took our boarding passes, she said to the guy, \"Sir, you\\'re in 1C, she\\'s in 1D.\" I put his stuff down in 1C, he said not one single word. And of course, you know who was next to me in 1F. Mister \"Would you take your effing argument elsewhere?\" So my friend Karen, who works for American, came on the plane to give the pilot his paperwork. She left and waved goodbye. When I got to Charlotte, she called me. She said, \"Paula, what happened? You were as white as a sheet.\" I told her and she said, \"Yeah. Welcome to the world of women.\" Now the truth is, I will not live long enough to lose my male privilege. I brought it with me when I transitioned. A lot of decades of being a man. But that doesn\\'t mean I don\\'t see my power diminishing. Let me tell you another thing I\\'ve observed. Apparently, since I became a female, I have become stupid. Yeah, I guess it\\'s the loss of testosterone and the arrival of estrogen that has caused me to lose the brain cells necessary to be a fully functioning adult human. Either that or I\\'m as smart as I ever was, it’s just now I\\'m constantly being subjected to mansplaining. So I was in my local Denver bike shop, and a young summer employee said, \"Can I help?\" And I said, \"Yeah, can the frame of an older Gary Fisher mountain bike start to flex and bend enough that it causes the rear brake to rub?\" He said, \"Well, disc brakes need regular adjustments.\" I said, \"I know that. And in fact, I do my brake adjustments.\" He said, \"Oh, well, then your rotor\\'s bent.\" I said, \"Yeah, my rotor is not bent. I know a bent rotor.\" With condescension, he said, \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" I said, \"You could answer my question.\" At which point Kyle, the manager of the shop, stepped in, he’s such a sweetheart. He said, “I think you’re probably right. Let me ask you a question. Do you only get a chirp coming from that rear brake when you\\'re pulling hard uphill?\" I said, \"Yes, exactly.\" He said, \"Yeah, that\\'s frame fatigue.\" I wanted to fall at the feet of Kyle and call him blessed. Someone was taking me seriously. This happens all the time now. I have to go three or four rounds with someone before I get a direct answer. And there\\'s a deeper issue. The more you\\'re treated as if you don\\'t know what you\\'re talking about, the more you begin to question whether or not you do, in fact, know what you\\'re talking about. Right? I understand a woman\\'s tendency to doubt herself. Do you ever notice if a woman is in a meeting with a group of men and she knows she\\'s right, she apologizes for it? She says, \"I\\'m sorry, but I don\\'t think those numbers add up.\" You know, you don\\'t have to apologize for being right. (Cheers and applause) Since I\\'m new to this gender, I asked my good friend Jen, I said, \"What are women looking for in men?\" She said, \"Women are looking for men who will honor our uniqueness, who will realize our gifting is not lesser, it\\'s not weaker, it\\'s just different. It is, in fact, more comprehensive. And it’s essential.” Now, of course, there are men who do honor women, lots of them. Like my good friend and fellow pastor Mark, who always draws out the best in me and then seems to take pleasure in watching me lead. We need more men like Mark who are willing to honor and empower women. I know I\\'m going to keep bumping into additional differences on this journey. But let me leave you with this. To the women, I offer my heartfelt thanks. I often feel like an interloper. A late arrival to the serious work of womanhood. But you show me grace and great mercy. I want you to know, you are far more capable than you realize. You are more powerful than you know, and you reflect the best parts of what it means to be fully human. And to you guys, who are probably feeling more than a little bit uncomfortable right now. I do understand. I never thought I had privilege. But I did. And so do you. What can you do? You can believe us when we tell you that we might, we might have equality, but we do not have equity. It is not a level playing field. It never has been. You can be a part of the solution by elevating us to equal footing. You uniquely have that power. And to all of us, do you know who I think about a lot? I think about my brown-skinned daughter. And my brown-skinned daughter-in-law. What do they know that I’m clueless about? What do any of us really know about the shoes in which we have never walked? It\\'s hard being a woman, it\\'s hard being a transgender woman. As a man, I just didn\\'t know what I didn\\'t know. Would I do it all again? Of course I would. Because the call toward authenticity is sacred, it\\'s holy, it\\'s for the greater good. For 45 years, my father was a fundamentalist pastor. My mother is even more conservative. When I came out as transgender, they rejected me. I thought I would never speak to them again. Last January, I took a chance and called my dad on his birthday, and he took my call. We talked for about a half hour, and about a month later I asked if I could come for a visit and they said yes. And last spring, I had a delightfully redemptive three-hour visit with them. I\\'ve met with them twice since. But that day, toward the end of the conversation that first day, my father said a number of precious things. As I stood to go ... He said ... As I stood to go, he said, \"Paula ...\" He called me \"Paula.\" (Audience murmurs) He said, \"Paula, I don\\'t understand this, but I am willing to try.\" My father is 93 years old, and he\\'s willing to try. What more could I ask? I hugged him so tightly. One man, willing to give up his power because he knew what he knew. That he loved his child. And he was willing to do whatever it takes to honor the journey of another. Thank you.'}, {'talk__id_text': 0, 'talk__id': '90955', 'talk__name': 'The breakthrough science of mRNA medicine ', 'talk__description': 'The secret behind medicines that use messenger RNA (or mRNA) is that they \"teach\" our bodies how to fight diseases on their own, leading to groundbreaking treatments for COVID-19 and, potentially one day, cancer, the flu and other ailments that have haunted humanity for millennia. RNA researcher Melissa J. Moore -- Moderna\\'s chief scientific officer and one of the many people responsible for the rapid creation and deployment of their COVID-19 vaccine -- takes us down to the molecular level, unraveling how mRNA helps our bodies\\' proteins maintain health, prevent disease and correct errors in our genetic code. \"We have entered an entirely new era of medicine,\" Moore says.', 'transcript': 'Now, many of the people watching this talk by now will have had one, two, three or even four doses of a messenger RNA vaccine. With billions of these shots now in arms. it’s clear that this new way of making vaccines is both remarkably safe and incredibly effective. But did you know it\\'s not the vaccine itself that\\'s keeping you safe? It\\'s actually you. Because the human body has amazing powers to both prevent and cure disease by making its own medicines. You just need to know what medicine to make. And that\\'s what your vaccine gave you. Simply a set of instructions for how to protect yourself against SARS-CoV-2. Now vaccines are only the beginning. As I said before, the advent of mRNA vaccines is heralding in an entirely new era of medicines. mRNAs give us the ability to not only prevent disease but also treat previously intractable disorders. But before I get to that, let\\'s talk about what is this new way of medicines really about? Well, it all comes down to proteins. Now, you may think of protein as simply something that you need to eat, an important part of your diet, something that\\'s important for you to build muscle. But it\\'s not just muscle that contains protein. Protein makes up a huge fraction of the incredibly complicated ecosystem that\\'s your entire body. In many ways, your body functions like a large city, full of myriad buildings, interconnected buildings, with lots of different structures. Now, just as the word \"building\" fails to capture the incredible variety of structures that make up any large city, the generic term \"protein\" gives no clue as to the incredible variety of molecular architectures at the molecular level. Like buildings, proteins are not monolithic. Our body makes many proteins. Some, like the collagen in our skin that makes our skin tough but pliable. Like the actin and myosin in our muscles that enable us to move. Or our blood is full of hemoglobin, ferrying oxygen around. Antibodies protecting us from disease, and clotting factors that close up our wounds. And for any of you that have ever cracked a biochemistry textbook, this should look familiar. This is the metabolic chart of the human body. These are all of the reactions in your body that are keeping you alive and well right now. And each one of those reactions is catalyzed by a different protein whose names are shown here in blue. So proteins are not only what makes up the bulk of your body, they’re also what make your body tick and keep you well. Now, if we think again about buildings, the structures of buildings may look quite different in the end, but they\\'re all made of a limited set of building materials and which of those building materials are used and how they\\'re arranged, and how they\\'re attached to one another gives the buildings their final form. The same is true of proteins. If we zoom down to the molecular level, we can see that proteins, if we unravel their three-dimensional architecture, are actually just long strings of building blocks. And these building blocks have different shapes and different propensities to interact with one another. So it\\'s which building blocks are used and the order in which they are in the chain that gives a protein is three-dimensional shape. Now here I\\'m only showing three proteins, but creating and maintaining a healthy human requires the combined action of over 100,000 different types of protein. And our bodies make them all. Thus our bodies are remarkable protein factories. At the molecular level, the numbers are truly mind-blowing. Each of the 30 trillion cells in your body -- that\\'s three with 13 zeros -- contains between one and 10 billion protein molecules. That means that you have as many protein molecules in your body as there are stars in the known universe. Now each different cell type in your body makes a different kind of protein, a different set of proteins, like the rods and cones in my eye that are detecting light right now and the neurons in my brain that are interpreting that light and enabling me to see you right now. So they make a particular set of proteins unique to it. And like any complex building project, you can imagine that the process of protein synthesis needs to be tightly regulated so that the right protein is made at the right time and in the right place. But of course, with anything so complicated, it\\'s perhaps not surprising that there\\'s an occasional mistake, a fault in the algorithm. Let\\'s go back to that metabolic chart. It’s estimated that one in 1,000 newborns are born without the ability to make one of the proteins on this chart. Therefore, they have lifelong complications due to inborn metabolic errors. Let\\'s take just one of those. Let\\'s talk about von Gierke\\'s disease or glycogen storage disease I. This is due to the lack of a protein circled here in red, whose job it is to release stored sugars so that you can maintain a healthy blood sugar level while you\\'re fasting. So von Gierke\\'s disease patients can\\'t fast. They must constantly eat small amounts of carbohydrates, including getting up every one or two hours during the night to eat raw cornstarch. Now, imagine the toll that this takes on parents. If they are ever to miss a feeding of their child, their child could slip into severe hypoglycemia, seizures and possibly death. But even if these patients can keep up this endless feeding cycle, they are plagued by lifelong complications, including delayed puberty, frequent infections, kidney disease and liver cancer. So von Gierke\\'s disease is just one example of a disorder where we know what protein is missing. What if we could give those patients back the ability to make that missing protein? Then we could actually treat their disease instead of just managing their symptoms. And that\\'s where mRNA comes in. That\\'s also where I come in. You see, I spent the better part of my career as an academic doing curiosity-based research into the fundamental principles of how proteins are made. And my specialty was messenger RNA. Like proteins, messenger RNAs are long chainlike molecules composed of building blocks. The four building blocks that make up messenger RNAs form what is known as the genetic code. As their name implies, messenger RNAs carry messages: messages that are translated by your body in order to create proteins. Thus messenger RNAs are the language of life. And the human body has a lot to say. So, like proteins, your cells are chock-full of messenger RNA. Every one of your 30 trillion cells has hundreds of thousands of messenger RNA molecules. Messenger RNAs are an essential component of all living organisms. So when you are eating protein-rich foods, you\\'re not only eating protein, you\\'re also eating lots of messenger RNA. Your body takes the messenger RNA in the food that you consumed, breaks it down into those component parts and then builds new messenger RNAs specific to your needs. Now this continual destruction and rebuilding is a feature true of almost all proteins and messenger RNAs in your body. Let\\'s take, for example, the circadian clock. This is the timer in your body that tells you when to be active and when to sleep. The proteins that make up this clock appear and disappear with remarkable regularity every day. The way that this is accomplished is that your body makes the messenger RNAs that encode those proteins appear and disappear every day. Every day for your entire life, you get your daily dose of clock messenger RNAs producing clock proteins. Now three properties of proper medicines are that their effects are of limited duration, that their effects are dose-dependent and that they can be given over and over again to produce the same effect. mRNA\\'s are transient. The amount of protein produced is dependent on how much of that mRNA is present. And they can be induced over and over again to produce the same effect. So wow, it seems so simple. If we could treat a disease, if there\\'s a protein that\\'s missing to treat a disease, then we could simply give a few copies of an mRNA to the body for it to produce that protein. If that protein\\'s only needed once, then maybe a single dose would suffice. If a protein is needed multiple times, then we can dose mRNA over and over again. And that\\'s exactly what\\'s happening. So when I went on clinicaltrials.gov this morning, it turns out that there are over 175 clinical trials now open using mRNA-based medicines that are recruiting patients. Another 54 clinical trials are waiting in the [wings], ready to be opened. So there is a coming tsunami of mRNA medicines. Last year, Moderna and AstraZeneca reported positive results from a clinical trial where patients during open heart surgery were dosed with messenger RNA injected directly into their heart muscles, that told their heart muscles to grow new blood vessels in order to get around clogged arteries. In other clinical trials we\\'re repeatedly dosing patients with inborn metabolic errors to treat their metabolic disease. In fact, one of those clinical trials that\\'s currently recruiting patients is for von Gierke\\'s disease. And for cancer patients, we\\'re creating personalized cancer vaccines. These vaccines are meant to train their bodies, their immune systems, to attack their cancers. These are truly personalized medicines, one vaccine for one person. Now for personalized cancer vaccines to be the most effective, we need to get them made and back to the patient as quickly as possible. We aim for a turnaround time of 45 days. By January of 2020, we had already manufactured, quality-controlled and delivered to several dozen patients personalized cancer vaccines. So we had the know-how and the capacity to manufacture vaccines quickly. Thus, when the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was posted to a public web server on January 10, 2020, we got immediately to work. Within two days, we had agreed with our collaborators at NIH on exactly which form of the spike protein to put in our vaccine. Because we had done so so many times before, it then took our mRNA design team just one hour to design the mRNA that we immediately -- That we immediately put on to our manufacturing equipment. We were then able to make that RNA, get it quality-controlled, fill-finished and shipped off to NIH for the clinical trial in 45 days. Now what I find -- What I find truly remarkable is that that mRNA sequence that took us one hour to design is the same mRNA sequence that went into your arms, that ended up in Spikevax, our now fully approved vaccine. One hour to design a medicine that has saved countless lives. It still gives me goosebumps every time I talk about it. So what does the future hold? Well, I\\'ve already told you about regenerative medicine and personalized cancer vaccines. For cancer patients, we can send in -- by directly injecting messenger RNA into their tumors -- we can send in instructions telling the tumor cells to self-destruct, Or having the tumor cells send out signals to the immune system, beckoning the immune system to attack. For patients with autoimmune disorders, we can send in signals that tamp down their overactive immune systems. And we and others are rapidly making many more messenger RNA vaccines. Because messenger RNA vaccines can be produced so quickly and rapidly, they\\'re really well suited for newly emerging diseases as well as other viruses, like the flu, where new variants come out every year, and the vaccines need to be updated. But one of the exciting things about mRNA medicines is we\\'re not limited to sending in the instructions for one protein at a time. mRNA medicines can be easily multiplexed. Therefore, we\\'re working on a combination vaccine for COVID, flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV: all leading causes of hospitalization and death in the elderly. And we\\'re hoping that this will then be an annual booster, that you will get, just like the flu vaccine. So finally, the very modest footprint of the manufacturing equipment for making messenger RNAs means that they can be made almost anywhere in the world. And to take this to an extreme, the American Defense Department started a program in 2019, and we\\'re working with them to miniaturize the entire process so that it can be fit into a single shipping container for rapid deployment anywhere in the world. So -- So to finish, I hope I\\'ve convinced you that we have entered an entirely new era of medicine. Having learned to speak the language of mRNA, the language of life, we can now use it to create medicines that are just for one person, like a personalized cancer vaccine, or can be rapidly produced and distributed to entire populations, like the COVID-19 vaccines. And the best part? The best part is we\\'re simply tapping into your body\\'s own ability to make its own medicines. Thank you.'}, {'talk__id_text': 22, 'talk__id': '90008', 'talk__name': 'NFTs, the metaverse and the future of digital art', 'talk__description': 'In need of a brief yet illuminating lesson on the obsession with NFTs? Elizabeth Strickler breaks down the acronym and explains the fundamentals of non-fungible tokens, sharing how these digital assets are changing the landscape for artists and content creators looking to cash in on their creations -- in and out of the metaverse.', 'transcript': 'Everything in the real world is being recreated in the virtual world. The metaverse. The metaverse, a persistent digital universe that mirrors our world, but is becoming as diverse and awe-inspiring as the natural world. And you\\'ll be able to do everything you do in the real world in the virtual world, and more. In the real world, you can walk into a gallery, buy a one-of-a-kind artwork that is signed and authenticated as original, take it home, put it on the wall, enjoy it, show it to your friends; it might even be an investment. The artwork becomes part of your story and adds meaning to your life. It marks a time and a feeling for you. Now, we can have the exact same experience in virtual galleries, with digital art. While this might seem like an obscure niche on the internet, let\\'s take a look at a recent auction sale that you might have heard of. In March of 2021, the major auction house Christie\\'s sold a purely digital artwork by an artist named Beeple for 69 million dollars in cryptocurrency. The auction, the artwork and the currency was virtual, but the transaction was very real. But who can afford a Beeple? Don\\'t worry, there are lots of artists creating digital art and conceptualizing brand new art forms that you can afford. I direct Media Entrepreneurship and Innovation at the Creative Media Industries Institute at Georgia State University, and our students are building the metaverse as I speak. We imagine a future where the students and all digital artists are able to continue building new visions and new worlds -- basically, a better internet -- and can make a living while doing so. The revolutionary instrument that allowed for a digital file to be sold as a unique artwork for 69 million dollars is the same tool that will allow our students to make livings as freelance creators. There is a paradigm shift happening that is turning the world of content creation and its financial rewards on its head. Gone are the days of the internet being a giant copying machine, of intermediaries taking a larger cut than the creators, and of artists not receiving royalties. This new automated tool that allows for guaranteed proof of origination and ownership of music, videos, images and even text is called an NFT: non-fungible token. The NFT is allowing everyone to own their own data, starting with art, and there is a hope that it will revolutionize how value is created online and how digital labor is monetized. So the eternal question: What is an NFT? Simply put, it is a permanent tracking device that proves ownership of a digital file, somewhat similar to the way that you can chip a pet to identify it as yours if it runs away, an NFT is a cryptographic token connected to a digital asset to preserve ownership rights in the metaverse. Non-fungible means \"not exchangeable.\" Most things in the real world are non-fungible, because most physical objects are unique and can\\'t be traded one for one. There is no painting, pet or person that is exactly equivalent to another. Money, on the other hand, is one of the few items that is fungible, meaning one dollar is equivalent to another dollar and one Bitcoin is equivalent to another Bitcoin. The underlying decentralized technology that enabled digital currencies such as Bitcoin is blockchain. Blockchain prevents digital money from being duplicated or hacked, and it removes the need for a centralized authority, such as a bank, to validate transactions. And like Bitcoin, the record of ownership of an NFT is kept in a public database on the internet that is maintained by millions of computers that keep track, via consensus, of all content origination and transactions. At the Blockchain Lab at Georgia State University, we study how to monetize creative labor using blockchains and other decentralized ledger technologies. I believe that this technology in the form of NFTs has the potential to humanize the internet and to create an equitable foundation for its next phase: the metaverse. This decentralized business model gives financial power back to the creators and reduces the power of the broker, the middleman and even social media platforms. Amy Rader is a fine artist in Atlanta who shows in traditional galleries. She created her first NFT so that she could expand to an online audience and to add a new revenue stream to increase her income. Here\\'s a Greg Mike mural. If you\\'re from Atlanta, you have probably seen some of his work on walls and buildings. Street art is not permanent, so how will an important cultural icon like Greg Mike utilize this new creative economy? He is using the unique qualities of NFTs to innovate and to collaborate with other artists and musicians and connect with fans on the internet. This way, his work will live on, and he can take the proceeds from the sales and resales and continue creating his art. Musicians can also capture their true value using NFTs. Atlanta music producer Dallas Austin is allowing fans to collect memorabilia of his great moments in music history, similar to the way that NBA Top Shot is allowing basketball fans to collect historical replays as NFTs. In the metaverse, humans are represented as avatars. An eight-year-old probably knows, but did you know that you can buy clothes for your avatar? This is Kadine James. She is leading the way in digital fashion that can only be worn in the virtual world. Today, Gucci sells sneakers that only exist in the virtual world, and you can never wear them, but your avatar can. Alternatively, you can use augmented reality to overlay virtual sneakers onto your in-real-life feet. And because of NFTs, anyone, not just well-known companies like Gucci, can create digital fashion to be bought, sold and worn in games, online platforms and even in avatar fashion shows. Take the pioneer 18-year-old FEWOCiOUS, who was way ahead of Gucci, with his crypto art and digital sneakers. The use of augmented and virtual-reality fashion is becoming mainstream, but because NFTs as art and collectibles are so new, the predictions are too volatile for anyone to make. But it is a sign that heavy hitters like Mark Cuban and Snoop Dogg are investing heavily. This is the new frontier for artists and their fans. And just like in the real world, and artist can sell a one-of-a-kind piece, make limited editions to control for scarcity, show in art galleries and market places. But with NFTs, you can also sell directly to your buyer without an intermediary, collect royalties on all future resales, expand your audience to the entire internet, show in virtual galleries and virtual worlds and sell 3D objects and clothes to virtual humans. OK, so how does this work, and how do you get involved as an artist? Your artwork is a digital file. To protect this file and capture the value of your labor in perpetuity, you go to a digital goods marketplace and \"mint\" it, meaning you register your work as a token, for a fee, on the blockchain. It will contain a signature, time stamp, and any rules around its resale. Once you’ve minted your work and you want to sell it, you connect with your community and let them know that your NFT has \"dropped,\" meaning it is for sale. It is important to note that all the same rules that make for good art and business apply in the virtual world: a strong connection to your followers, an authentic or compelling story and consistent output and work ethic. So who will buy your art, or how do you get involved as a collector? Buyers go to the same marketplaces that artists use. There, you look for art that you appreciate and artists you want a direct connection with. Some people invest because the artwork resonates with them, or they recognize great talent, or they see a potential for that artist to play a significant part in history. Once purchased directly from the artist, you store your NFTs in your digital wallet. From there, you can show on screens and online marketplaces, or in galleries, such as RareRooms, a blockchain innovation by Atlanta\\'s GigLabs. And with NFTs, a buyer knows their art is fair trade, transactions are transparent, and the ecosystem is equitable. The metaverse is a place where we will spend more and more of our lives. Who builds it, who owns it and how it is built will determine what this world becomes. But just like the real world, the metaverse is very complex, and there are many problems yet to be solved. And that is where you come in. You are the future, a digital citizen whose responsibility it is to be a good steward to the metaverse, making sure that it is diverse, equitable, accessible and sustainable. This is just the beginning of the decentralized movement. NFTs will revolutionize most online industries, but it is starting with the creative economy. While nothing in this talk is financial advice, it is definitely educational encouragement. And why not start learning through art? Jump in. We need you. I would like to thank the artists who provided the art for this talk, all of which are embedded in the blockchain as NFTs, non-fungible tokens.'}, {'talk__id_text': 34, 'talk__id': '89893', 'talk__name': 'Goats, blockchain and the future of money', 'talk__description': 'What if smallholder farmers could use their produce and livestock to pay for goods and services?

The residents of Pathan Goth were living without access to basic facilities such as water and electricity. The community was bussing water two hours from Karachi. This made their water so expensive that their livestock went without water every other day. Bathing and laundry was a luxury. The solution was simple: a solar water pump. But that would cost $10,000. And for a community where the average household earned just about $70 a month, this was beyond their affordability. As I sat there thinking about this issue, the solution literally walked in front of me. A herd of more than 100 goats crossed my path. And I thought to myself, that is a lot of goats. I took a chance and asked the village elder: Would they consider paying me for their pump in goats? He agreed, and that is how Pathan Goth got its pump and I became the proud owner of 40 goats. A few months down the line, the Muslim festival of Eid came around. During Eid, livestock is offered to honor Abraham’s willingness to sacrifice Isaac. And much like shopping before Christmas, the demand for goats goes up, and the price skyrockets. I remembered my goats and decided to put up a post on Facebook asking my friends and family to buy their Eid goat from me that year. Within a week I sold all my goats. And even after paying for a team to do transport and manage them, I more than recovered the cost of the pump. This experience made me question the idea of money and how it has changed and evolved for us. I found that in 2500 BC, Mesopotamia, Sumerians used measured quantity of barley as money. But as the trading circle grew beyond one village, money's key characteristics changed and evolved. Money not only needed to reliably store value but also be easy to convert and easy to transport. That is when we -- civilization -- moved towards coin and paper money. But coin and paper money get value only when they’re validated by an external authority, such as God, crown or the central bank. Technology today enables us to bypass the need for this central authority. Today, the value of any asset can be transferred from one person to another using blockchain. Any asset can now be tokenized, digitized and traded. So technology is not only disrupting the need for a financial intermediary in mainstream economy but also has the potential to disrupt and democratize economic power in more rural economies. By removing the need for inefficient and expensive intermediaries, small farmers can derive greater value from what they grow and raise. Livestock is very abundant in these communities. Farmers literally use their goats and cows as ATM machines and as saving instruments. They will sell an animal when they need cash, such as to buy fodder for the rest of the herd, to buy groceries for their home or for weddings and health emergencies. But these communities have never been able to use their goats and cows for larger, more productive assets ... until now. Our farmers are able to convert 15 goats into a solar water pump. Previously, these communities would rely on or wait for an NGO, a charity or the government to take notice and give them what they needed. Now they are using their own resources to fulfill their own needs when they need it. This is self-reliance. (Applause and cheers) So how have we enabled the use of goats as a reliable form of currency? Right now, we we work with farmers through physical barter. At the time of the solar installation, we take possession of the goats. We then sell these goats as meat to grocery chains and through our own retail brand. Every goat that we receive is then recorded, as its unique ID -- its key characteristics such as its sex, its age, its weight and even its number of teeth are taken into account. And then using these, we assign each goat a dollar or a rupee value, essentially tokenizing a goat. We have already worked with 45 communities, enabling more than 6,000 farmers to convert their goats into water and electricity. We are now planning to add smartphones, tractors and other equipment. My hope is that we can create a more inclusive economic system where any person or any community can use what they grow and raise as money. Where a farmer, a small farmer can use, wherever he is, whether it’s Pakistan, Nepal, Somalia, can use a digitized goat to pay for her kid’s school fees, a tractor or a smartphone. This future isn't quite here yet, but I hope using goats as money gets us closer. Thank you.
